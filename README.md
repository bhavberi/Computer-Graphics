## Spring 2022-23
# **Computer Graphics**

An amazing half-semester Elective course (Taught by Dr. Avinash Sharma, Assistant Professor, CVIT, IIITH) is full of great learning, experience and ups-downs.

Got to learn a lot from this course, and this was as practical as it was theoretical. (Which can be seen easily from the Assignments...)

You may feel assignments tough at one point of time, but moving ahead, you'll feel good after completing them and seeing the final result.
